# SeeSeePortal

Welcome to SeeSeePortal, the totally-not-suspicious, definitely-not-blocked, parody version of that game site everyone keeps trying to open during class. But here’s the twist:

***Every game on this site was created by middle school game designers.***

Real students. Real code. Real chaos.

## Why did we do this?
* To celebrate the creativity of student game developers.
* To give their projects a home that looks way cooler than a class folder.
* To poke a little fun at the endless cat-and-mouse game between middle schoolers and network filters everywhere.
* And most importantly: to prove that students can build games just as fun (or… let’s be honest, funnier) than the ones they're always trying to sneak into class.

## What you'll find here
A growing collection of:
* Off-brand, student-built versions of classic game ideas
* Wild original concepts that could only come from middle school minds
* Projects full of bugs, brilliance, and pure “I had five minutes left” energy
* Proof that learning to code is way cooler than dodging web filters
* We hope you enjoy playing these games as much as our students enjoyed creating them!

## A note to teachers and IT departments
Don’t worry - this site is actually educational. It’s full of logic, coding, problem-solving, creativity… and absolutely zero attempts to hide browser tabs. (Probably.)

## Enjoy the games!
Whether you’re here to play, browse student creations, or just enjoy a parody site that somehow survived being blocked… welcome aboard.
